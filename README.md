# Streams of Georgia

To use the [USGS REST IV service](http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/) with DataTables, I had to build a proxy server.

The proxy server was created using Express and is located in the `/server` directory.

This is really the same idea as [one of my previous projects](https://github.com/kdavidmoore/usgs-rest). Old wine in new bottles.

Note: the proxy server has to be running on `localhost:3015` for this app to work.

## Built with
* Express
* jQuery
* [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
* Bootstrap 4 Alpha 4
